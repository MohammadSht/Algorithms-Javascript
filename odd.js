//print odd
//Pseudocode:
//1-definded variable called i.
//2-make for loop  with first  number and last number and loop throw it.
//3-if statement that check if  the  number  is not  divisible by 2.
//4- print the result.

//Code:

var i ;
for( i=1; i<=135; i++){
if(i%2 ===1 ) {
    console.log(i)
}

}
//Diagram:
//i=1 output =1.
//i=2 output =0 because 2%2=0 
//i=3 output =1,3
//i=5 output =1.3.5

//i=135 output =1.3.5.7...,135
