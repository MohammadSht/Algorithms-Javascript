//pseudocode:
//1-defined a variabale called i.
//2-defined a variable  sum to save the result and equal it to 0.
//3-make loop from 1 to 135.
//4-add the new number to the sum variable.
//5-print number is :i sum :sum 

//Code:
var i;
var sum =0;
for(i=1; i<=135; i++ ){
    sum+=i ;
    console.log( 'Number is: ',i,'sum',sum)
}

//diagram:
//i= 1 output = Number is  1, 2.
//i= 2 output = Number is  1, 3.
//i= 3 output = Number is  1, 6.
//i= 4 output = Number is  1, 10.


//i= 135 output = Number is  135, 9180.
